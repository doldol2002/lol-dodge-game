[CS 583] 2D Game Project

Welcome to LOL Dodge Game, a 2D survival arcade game where your goal is to survive as long as possible. Your goal is to dodge an increasing tempo of projectiles inspired by League of Legends.

Features
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Increasing Difficulty: The speed, frequency, and patterns of projectiles ramp up the longer you survive.

(in progress)
High Score Tracking: Compete against yourself to get the longest possible survival time. 


How to Play
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dodge: Move around the arena to avoid being hit by projectiles.

Projectiles: 
- Lux's beam will first shoot a thin line which is okay to touch but couple seconds later will thicken into a wider beam that will kill the player.
- Ezreal's mystic shot will be thrown from different sides of the map!
- Veigar's dark matter will first indicate where it will be landing and grow in size until a boom. Don't touch the boom!
  
Goal: Survive as long as you can!


Controls
